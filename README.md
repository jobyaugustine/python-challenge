Please see the folders for PyBank and PyPoll assignments.


## PyBank

Python script Main.py is created to calculate:

2) The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

 3) Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

4) The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

 5)  The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
 
 Script generates the results in the terminal.
 
 The result is written to a text file result.txt,  and is in the **Analysis** folder.
